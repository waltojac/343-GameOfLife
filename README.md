# 343-GameOfLife
Project Folder for Game of Life Project

Notes:
  1. To edit the board size, I suggest using the "New Board" option. The size is stored in the file as ASCII characters, and
     they are not visible below a certain size. 
  2. I did not play with command line arguments because the loop provides more instruction and functionality.
  3. I used CLion to build this project. I tested it from command line too. The only difference is that in terminal, the files 
     have to be in the same folder as main to be loaded. CLion puts them in the debug folder.
